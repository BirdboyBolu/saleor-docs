title: Upgrading from 3.11 to 3.12
---

## Preparation

Version 3.12 introduces some breaking changes necessary to ensure the highest quality of our API.

## Updated discount rounding mode

From Saleor 3.12 the discount rounding mode has changed from `ROUND_DOWN` to `ROUND_HALF_UP`.
The change affects the discount amount and total price of future checkouts and orders with a percentage discount applied.
The discount amount might be 0.01 greater, and the total price might be 0.01 lower.
E.g. if you had an order for $13 and applied a 12.5% discount, you would get $11.38
with a $1.62 discount, but now it will be calculated as $11.37 with $1.63 discount.
